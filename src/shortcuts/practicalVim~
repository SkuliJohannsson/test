#practical vim - chapter 8
#h: motion.txt is good. Learn a couple of motions each week at least, he says.
fx	to next x (current line)
fx;	to second next x (current line)
dt;	delete to ; (current line)
,	you repeated the last char search one too often. What to do?
d/get enter 	delete all to next occurrance of 'get' (global) - impressive move

#pv - Chapter 8 - text objects - the scissor kick of vim
dab, da(, da)	(a|bc)=>|
diBx esc, d{x esc, di}x esc	{a|bc}=>{x|}
ci"# esc citch esc	<a href="{u|rl}">{title}</a> => <a href="#">ch|</a>
daw	del curront word from sentence
ciwx esc	change current word to x

#pv - Chapter 9 - Navigate between files with jumps
:jumps		show jump list
C-o		go to previous position in jump list
C-i		go to newer position in jump list
:changes	show change list ( buffer wide )
g;		go to previous change in change list
g,		go to newer change in change list
`.		got to last change

#pv - chapter 9 - extra helpful
gi		go to where you last were in insert mode
gf 		go to file under cursor(or selected text). Super helpful, but often requires some setup to really shine. Need to maybe add stuff to suffixesadd and path variables. A wormhole feature.
C-]		also a super wormhole feature but often needs some setup
`V		go to global mark V ( may be .vimrc as an example ) - saved between sessions
mV		set global mark V (.vimrc maybe)

#pv - Chapter 10 - registers
F xp	Practica lvi|m => Practical| vim
#ddp	move line down
yyp	copy line down
"0p	paste from yank register
_	black hole register
:reg ab	see contents of registers a and b
"+p	paste to system clipboard register
#"*	X11 primary register, used with middle mouse button
%	Current file name register
#	Alternate file name register
/	last search pattern register
viwp	paste over current word using visual (try pasting again, and the visual content is now there)
C-r 0	i_paste from yank register - sometimes intuitive for short texts
gP	paste before, place cursor in front. - can be very useful when copying many lines at once.

#practical vim command line
